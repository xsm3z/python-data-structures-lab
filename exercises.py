# Exercise 1: List and Indexing
#
# Create a list named students containing at least three student names (strings).
# Assign the second student’s name to a variable named first_student.
# Assign the last student’s name to a variable named last_student.

def manage_students():
    students = ["Maddy", "Charlie", "Auggie"]
    first_student = students[1]
    last_student = students[-1]
    return {"First Student": first_student, "Last Student": last_student}

# Call the function and print the result
print('Exercise 1:', manage_students())


# Exercise 2: Loop and String Concatenation
#
# Create a tuple named foods containing the same number of foods (strings) as there are names in the students list.
# Create a variable named meal and assign an empty string to it.
# Use a for loop to iterate over the strings in foods and append each string to meal.

def combine_foods():
    foods = ["Pasta", "Burgers", "Pizza"]
    meal = ""
    for food in foods:
        meal += food + " "
    return meal

# Call the function and print the result
print('Exercise 2:', combine_foods())


# Exercise 3: Slicing Tuples
#
# Using the slice operator, assign a new tuple containing only the last two food strings in the foods to a variable named last_two_foods.

def slice_foods():
    foods = ["Pasta", "Burgers", "Pizza"]
    last_two_foods = foods [-2:]
    return last_two_foods

# Call the function and print the result
print('Exercise 3:', slice_foods())


# Exercise 4: Dictionaries and String Formatting
#
# Create a dictionary named home_town containing the keys of city, state, and population.
# Using the home_town dictionary, assign to a variable named home_town_message a string with this format: “I was born in <city>, <state> - population of <population>”

def hometown_info():
    home_town = {"city": "Fairfax", "state": "Virginia", "population": 1141878}
    home_town_message = home_town_message = f"I was born in {home_town['city']}, {home_town['state']} - population of {home_town['population']}"
    return home_town_message

# Call the function and print the result
print('Exercise 4:', hometown_info())


# Exercise 5: Iterating Over Dictionary Items
#
# Define an empty list named home_town_items.
# Use a for loop to iterate over the key: value pairs in the home_town dictionary and append a string with the following format to home_town_items: "<key> = <value>"

def list_home_town_items():
    home_town = {"city": "Fairfax", "state": "Virginia", "population": 1141878}
    home_town_items = []
    for key, value in home_town.items():
        home_town_items.append(f"{key} = {value}")
    return home_town_items

# Call the function and print the result
print('Exercise 5:', list_home_town_items())
